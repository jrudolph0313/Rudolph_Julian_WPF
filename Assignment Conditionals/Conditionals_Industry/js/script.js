//ask user what the weekly average of beer sold in USD
var weekAverage=prompt("How much does your bar sell on an average week in $USD?");
//Check with console
//console.log(weekAverage);
//The numbers are made up, depending on which day will determine how much can be attributed to the day the user chooses.  since there are only 3 different percentages in a week, i will make these an array
var percentDaily=[.05, .1, .35];
//check with console
